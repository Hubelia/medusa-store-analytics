Medusa "store-analytics" is a plugin which shows analytics data of your store, including orders, sales and other useful information.

### Why?

Knowledge about your store is crucial to take proper action to increase the sales. Analytics data can show various things like what is a most popular region, sales channel or on which day people are buying the most. Every such data may help to find problem and possible solutions. 

## Getting Started

### Plugin system

Plugins are not yet supported in Medusa 2.0, so this part is TODO.

### Copy the code

You can copy the code from /src into your Medusa project.

Add module to your `medusa-config.js` file:

```js
{
  // If you copied the code
  resolve: "./modules/store-analytics"
}
```

## How can I use it?

After installation of plugin, you shall be able to see new option on sidebar. Click `Analytics` and see data about your store.

</p>

**WARNING**:

Depends on the number of your orders, customers and other - it might take a while to load them all if you click wider options like `Last year` or `All time`!

### Configuration

No configuration is needed. Everything is done through UI. You can use such options like:
- set different range for dates
- set different statuses of orders for calculation
- enabling/disabling comparison feature
